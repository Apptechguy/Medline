        <h2>Human Body</h2>
        <p>human body, the physical substance of the human organism, composed of living cells and extracellular materials and organized into tissues, organs, and systems.

            Human anatomy and physiology are treated in many different articles. For detailed discussions of specific tissues, organs, and systems, see human blood; cardiovascular system; digestive system, human; endocrine system, human; renal system; skin; human muscle system; nervous system; reproductive system, human; respiration, human; sensory reception, human; skeletal system, human <a href="image.html">See Pictures</a>.</p>
        <h3>The Body Functions & Life Process</h3>
        <p><b>Life Process</b>
            All living organisms have certain characteristics that distinguish them from non-living forms. 
            The basic processes of life include organization, metabolism, responsiveness, movements, and reproduction.
            In humans, who represent the most complex form of life, there are additional requirements such as growth, <br> differentiation, respiration, digestion, and excretion. All of these processes are interrelated. No part of the body, from the smallest cell to a complete body system, works in isolation. All function together, in fine-tuned balance, for the well being of the individual and to maintain life. <br> Disease such as cancer and death represent a disruption of the balance in these processes.</p>


        <p><b>Body Functions</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Organization</b>
                    At all levels of the organizational scheme, there is a division of labor. <br>Each component has its own job to perform in cooperation with others. <br> Even a single cell, if it loses its integrity or organization, will die.</li><br>
                <li><b>Metabolism</b>Metabolism is a broad term that includes all the chemical reactions that occur in the body. <br> One phase of metabolism is catabolism in which complex substances are broken down into simpler building blocks and energy is released.</li>
